    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)

    Backend: REST API (/move, /record, /play, /stop, /status)

    Hardware: Arduino, ESP32, or any microcontroller with PWM & WiFi

    Servos: Standard SG90 or similar (Base, Right Arm, Left Arm, Gripper)





üîå Hardware Setup

    4x Servo motors (Base, Right Arm, Left Arm, Gripper)

    Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno, ESP32)

    Power supply for servos

    Connect servos to PWM-compatible pins



    üåê Backend API

Implement a simple server (Arduino sketch, Flask, Node.js, etc.) to support:

    /move?servo=base&value=90

    /record?action=start|stop

    /play

    /auto

    /stop

    /status (returns JSON with current servo positions)
